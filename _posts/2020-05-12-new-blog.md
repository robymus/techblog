Finally (or again, after several tries and abandonment) I'm starting to document my tech journey. Like a dinosaur I am, I'm choosing a dinosaur platform, blogging. At least doing it the trendy way on GitHub Pages. 

I will try to post interesting things about what I'm working on and what I'm experimenting with.

I'm using the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) template for starters. I did some customization, adjusted for local serving with Jekyll and trying to get accustomed to its features. Markdown is fun, I might find myself liking it.
